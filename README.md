To use the bot you will need to create a .env file and put something like this in it: DISCORD_API_TOKEN='Your Token', it is the safest way to store your token on github, replit and other websites like that.

You need a few requirements for this bot. To get the requirements you will need to open visual code studio or your code editing software and execute this command in the terminal: <bold>pip install -r requirements.txt</bold>
